# Data-612-
This file allowed us to learn more about adding columns in Pandas and working with manipulating data types.

We changed the data type to date time and then found the max date. We took this max date and took all other dates and subtracted from them creating a new column.

We then produced our results, saved the file and uploaded here to Github :)
